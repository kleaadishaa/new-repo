## Implementation Notes

- **Data Storage:** All sections use `localStorage` to persist data in the browser.  
  - Only the **Today section** resets daily.  
  - Other sections persist indefinitely.
- **Frontend Focus:** This project emphasizes DOM manipulation, local storage management, and dynamic user interfaces.  
- **Notifications:** To implement notifications for important tasks, a backend or service worker is required. This version focuses on frontend functionality.
